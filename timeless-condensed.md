# A Book Report on The Timeless Way of Building

"a book that is extremely difficult to summarize, because it tries to change the way you think"

# Christopher Alexander

- Genius
    - 50s Physics at Chemistry at Cambridge
    - Harvard fellowship, first Harvard architecture PhD

# What is The Timeless Way of Building?

- manifesto
    - new school of architecture
    - ergonomics, user experience
    - requires tons of groundwork to begin to explain to people like us
    - i suspect it was heavily influenced by chinese thought, specifically by the daodejing

# What are its goals?

- To rehabilitate the use of the gut instinct in architecture
- To make intuitive aesthetic arguments more important to architects
- To improve the quality of aesthetic arguments
- Reaction against the international school et al

# founding myth 1/2
- "in most times and places, everyone made their own tools and built their own houses"
    - could alter things to their liking

# founding myth 2/2
- factories + machines + capitalism = relying on black boxes for everything
    - specialists
    - consumers
    - delicate disposable machines in sealed cases

# what did we lose?
- the ability to optimize our environments
    - want to climb ladder to catwalk
        - thwarted every time
    - i come in sweaty every morning and can't take a shower
        - put on tons of deodorant and wear shorts and t-shirts
    - inconveniences add up, become "stress"

# what did we lose?
- "the quality without a name"
- timeless, objective, precise, alive, glowing, healthy, easy, comfortable, self-sustaining, beautiful, free
- suspiciously similar to the Dao
- subgeniuses know it as "Slack"
- the product of a sophisticated wellness-detection algorithm woven throughout our thought processes

# and so
"I began to wonder if there was a code, like the genetic code, for human acts of building. A fluid code, which generates this quality in buildings, and makes them live.  Is there some process which takes place inside a person's mind, when he allows himself to generate buildings, which is so simple that all the people of a society can use it, and so generate not only individual buildings, but whole neighborhoods and towns?"

# pattern languages
- an idea he develops in a way derivative of the daodejing
    - repetition
    - word pictures
    - simple declarative statements
    - provocations challenging biases etc
- naturally and intuitively formed
    - abstractions of our environments
    - systems for maximizing beauty-heuristics
- formed of "design patterns"

# design patterns
"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."
- Gang of Four puts it well, especially for software developers
    - name, problem, solution
        - explicitly not machine-encodable algorithms
            - (the fitness algorithm runs on a computer made of meat inside your head and is not portable)
        - extremely helpful to point out problems you may not realize exist until it's too late

# obvious applicability to software

- everyone who deals with a code base changes it
- development work means making architectural decisions constantly
    - "what do i do at this juncture"
- dev work also means solving the same kinds of problems over and over
- pattern compendia: "this can be a problem

# harmony with feathers

- gives you patterns for dealing with problems that make your code base hard to work with
    - "I'm changing the same code all over the place"
    - "I don't know what tests to write"
    - "I don't understand the code well enough to change it"
    - "We Feel Overwhelmed. It Isn't Going to Get Any Better."

# problems in honest engine (expand tomorrow, at length)

- rescue nil => throw and log exceptions
- javascript component initialized in three different places = micro-thwarting whenever you change it => self-initializing modules that alter their behavior based on page markup
- jquery soup => event mediators and self-consciously limited DOM manipulation

# but dont just focus on the bad

- there's a quality to good code
- difficult to name
- succinct, expressive, readable, efficient, easy to change, easy to use with other software

# bringing it on home

- patterns are not immutable facts of nature, they're situationally dependent
- you use them without thinking about it, they are a part of the way people think
- becoming more aware of them can sharpen your thinking

# advice
- identify problems and solve them
- think about why the problems exist in the first place and see if you can make them impossible
- actually read his book and use the philosophical tools it gives you
    - it didn't really fit into the presentation but it's the whole point of the book
        - i can tell you more about it if you want
- continue building things for several decades=
- ideas

# see also: "a pattern language"

- how to design a region, from its road networks to its bathrooms
- has anyone tried writing on the same format for software?
    - if not, someone who does it could make a name for themselves
